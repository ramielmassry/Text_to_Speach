TTS can take words on a computer or other digital device and convert them into audio.
TTS is very helpful for kids and adults who struggle with reading. 
Print materials in school — like books and handouts — can create barriers for kids with reading challenges.
That’s because some kids struggle with decoding and understanding words on the page. Using digital text with TTS can help.
Since TTS lets kids both see and hear text when reading, it creates a multisensory reading experience. 
And like audiobooks, TTS won’t slow down the development of kids’ reading skills.
